# ContractQA

## Problem statement

Create a library where you upload a contract, execute a sequence of prompts to retrieve information from the contract and display it. The llm calls should be designed so it can work with different llms. Output insights as JSON.


## Approach

- [ ] Parse PDF documents (Azure Doc Intelligence)
- [ ] Chunk the parsed documents 
- [ ] Load the chunks into a Vector DB (Undecided)
- [ ] Look at indexing the DB
- [ ] Figure out prompts to chain execute (Python/Java)
- [ ] Output in JSON 
- [ ] Make a streamlit UI (Python)
